# 'Bookshelf'

Small vanilla JS application that allows users to add and remove books with various properties to and from a 'bookshelf'. 

Books are instances of a 'Book' object with several properties. User can toggle whether or not they've read a book via a button which triggers a method on the 'Book' object prototype.
